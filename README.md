# Lateral-and-Logitudinal-Control-of-Self-Driving-Vehicle
This Project is from the course Introduction to Self-Driving Cars on Coursera.org. For the final project in this course, I have developed control code to navigate a self-driving car around a racetrack in the CARLA simulation environment. i have constructed car controller by applying Stanley method for lateral control and PID controller for longitudinal control models for a vehicle. Also it create controllers that regulate speed and path tracking performance using Python.
